## My Process  

### Built With  

- **Semantic HTML5** for clean and accessible markup  
- **CSS custom properties** for maintainability  
- **Flexbox** for layout structuring  
- **CSS Grid** for advanced layout control  
- **Mobile-first workflow** for responsiveness  

### What I Learned  

This project challenged me to refine my **CSS styling** and ensure my design matched the reference as closely as possible. Key takeaways:  

- **Custom Styling Adjustments:** The provided styles didnâ€™t fully match the design, so I had to tweak them or create new ones.  
- **BEM Naming Convention:** I structured my CSS using the **Block Element Modifier (BEM)** methodology to maintain semantic and readable markup.  
- **Semantic HTML5 Improvements:** I researched and applied semantic elements to improve the structure:  
  - `<main>` for the main content  
  - `<section>` for distinct sections  
  - `<figure>` for the blog image  
  - `<h1>` for the primary heading  

Using **semantic HTML** improves **accessibility**, **SEO**, and **code maintainability**. Moving forward, I will continue replacing unnecessary `<div>` elements with meaningful tags.  

### Continued Development  

In future projects, I plan to:  

- Explore **CSS animations** for interactive UI enhancements  
- Improve **accessibility** by refining ARIA attributes  
- Use **CSS variables** more effectively for scalable design systems  

### Useful Resources  

- [MDN Web Docs - Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) - Helped me understand the importance of using semantic elements.  
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A great reference for structuring layouts efficiently.
